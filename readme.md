This program produces Fibonacci sequences through different methods and displays the statistics used to evaluate bigO notation.

The program can produce a Fibonacci sequence through iteration, recursion, memoized recursion, and **PLANNED** optimized cache memoized recursion.

The program can display the run time and the approximate amount of processes a function takes to produce a Fibonacci sequence.

So far, I have calculated:
    Iterative: O(n^2)
    Recursive: O(2^n)
    Memoized Recursion: O(n^2)
    Optimized Cache Memoized Recursion: **Projected** O(n)
